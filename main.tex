\section{\typedef{QUESTION:}}Two dice are thrown . The events A,B and C are as follows:\\
A: getting an even number on first dice\\
B: getting an odd number on first dice\\
C: getting sum of the number on the dice less than or equal to 5\\
Describe the events\\

\typedef{ANSWER:-}  The sample space for throwing two dice is:-

S=\{\{1,1\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{1,4\},\{1,5\},\{1,6\},\{2,1\},\{2,2\},\{2,3\},\{2,4\},\{2,5\},\{2,6\},\{3,1\},\{3,2\},\{3,3\},\{3,4\},\{3,5\},\{3,6\},\{4,1\},\{4,2\},\{4,3\},\{4,4\},\{4,5\},\{4,6\},\{5,1\},\{5,2\},\{5,3\},\{5,4\},\{5,5\},\{5,6\},\{6,1\},\{6,2\},\{6,3\},\{6,4\},
\{6,5\},\{6,6\}\}\\

The three events A,B and C are defined below:-\\

A=\{\{2,1\},\{2,2\},\{2,3\},\{2,4\},\{2,5\},\{2,6\},\{4,1\},\{4,2\},\{4,3\},\{4,4\},\{4,5\},\{4,6\},\{6,1\},\{6,2\},\{6,3\},\{6,4\},\{6,5\},\{6,6\}\\
B=\{\{1,1\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{1,4\},\{1,5\},\{1,6\},\{3,1\},\{3,2\},\{3,3\},\{3,4\},\{3,5\},\{3,6\},\{5,1\},\{5,2\},\{5,3\},\{5,4\},\{5,5\},\{5,6\}\\
C=\{\{1,1\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{1,4\},\{2,1\},\{2,2\},\{2,3\},\{3,1\},\{3,2\},\{4,1\}\}\\


Describe the events1.A'2.not B 3.A or B 4.A and B 5.A but not C 6.B or C 7.B and C 8. A and B' and C


1.A'-Getting an odd number on the first dice\\
A'=\{\{1,1\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{1,4\},\{1,5\},\{1,6\},\{3,1\},\{3,2\},\{3,3\},\{3,4\},\{3,5\},\{3,6\},\{5,1\},\{5,2\},\{5,3\},\{5,4\},\{5,5\},\{5,6\}\\
2. not B- Getting an even number on the first dice\\
B'=\{\{2,1\},\{2,2\},\{2,3\},\{2,4\},\{2,5\},\{2,6\},\{4,1\},\{4,2\},\{4,3\},\{4,4\},\{4,5\},\{4,6\},\{6,1\},\{6,2\},\{6,3\},\{6,4\},\{6,5\},\{6,6\}\\
3.A or B-getting even number or getting an odd number on first dice.\\
A or B=\{\{1,1\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{1,4\},\{1,5\},\{1,6\},\{2,1\},\{2,2\},\{2,3\},\{2,4\},\{2,5\},\{2,6\},\{3,1\},\{3,2\},\{3,3\},\{3,4\},\{3,5\},\{3,6\},\{4,1\},\{4,2\},\{4,3\},\{4,4\},\{4,5\},\{4,6\},\{5,1\},\{5,2\},\{5,3\},\{5,4\},\{5,5\},\{5,6\},\{6,1\},\{6,2\},\{6,3\},\{6,4\},
\{6,5\},\{6,6\}\}

4. A and B=Getting an odd and even number on first dice.\\
A and B=NULL\\
5. A but not C- Getting an even number on the first dice and the sum is more than 5.\\
A but not C=\{\{2,4\},\{2,5\},\{2,6\},\{4,2\},\{4,3\},\{4,4\},\{4,5\},\{4,6\},\{6,1\},\{6,2\},\{6,3\},\{6,4\},\{6,5\},\{6,6\}\\
6.B or C=\{\{1,1\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{1,4\},\{1,5\},\{1,6\},\{3,1\},\{3,2\},\{3,3\},\{3,4\},\{3,5\},\{3,6\},\{5,1\},\{5,2\},\{5,3\},\{5,4\},\{5,5\},\{5,6\}\{2,1\},\{2,2\},\{2,3\},\{4,1\}\}
7.B and C- Getting an odd number on the first dice and sum is less than or equal to 5\\
B and C=\{\{1,1\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{1,4\},\{3,1\},\{3,2\},\{3,3\}\}\\
8. A and B' and C'-Getting an even number on the first dice and sum on both dice is greater than 5.\\
A and B' and C'=&\{\{2,4\},\{2,5\},\{2,6\},\{4,2\},\{4,3\},\{4,4\},\{4,6\},\{6,1\},\{6,2\},\{6,3\},\{6,4\},\{6,5\},\{6,6\}\\
